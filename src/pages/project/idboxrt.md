During my tenure at [IDboxRT](https://idboxrt.com/es/), I had the opportunity to be an integral part of the monitoring team. My main contributions focused on the development of Drivers, also known as microservices, which were a crucial part of the platform. Additionally, I was part of the DevOps team, where we carried out maintenance tasks for the IDbox platform, ensuring its proper functioning.

My role also covered key areas such as cybersecurity, cloud, and administration, where I gained valuable experience and knowledge. As part of this team, we provided specialized services in Zabbix, where I took on the role of tool administrator, managing system monitoring and contributing to its optimization. This experience allowed me to enhance my skills both in software development and in platform and security administration, making significant contributions to the performance and protection of the companyâ€™s technological environments.

This period at [IDboxRT](https://idboxrt.com/es/) was a valuable opportunity to expand my skills and knowledge in programming and monitoring systems.
